  <AppAdminDashboard />
</DashboardLayout>
```

### Key Features:

3. **Organization Selector**: For non-app-admin users to switch organizations
4. **Mobile Support**: Responsive design with collapsible mobile sidebar
5. **Current Page Detection**: Highlights active navigation item

## ✅ Verification Steps

### To Test Navigation Persistence:
1. Visit http://localhost:3000/admin
2. Navigate to http://localhost:3000/organizations
3. Navigate to http://localhost:3000/dashboard
4. Verify sidebar and header remain visible throughout navigation
5. Test mobile responsiveness

### Expected Behavior:
- ✅ Sidebar remains visible when switching between admin pages
- ✅ Header with user menu stays persistent
- ✅ Current page is highlighted in navigation
- ✅ Organization selector appears for non-app-admin users
- ✅ Mobile sidebar works correctly

## 🎉 Issue Resolution

### Before:
- Admin and organizations pages lacked proper layout wrapping

- Inconsistent layout structure across admin routes

### After:
- All admin pages consistently use DashboardLayout component
- Persistent sidebar and header across all navigation
- Unified navigation experience for app admin users
- Proper current page highlighting and role-based menu items

## 🚀 Next Steps

1. **Test Navigation Flow**: Verify all links work correctly between admin pages
2. **Validate Layout Consistency**: Ensure consistent spacing and styling
3. **Test Mobile Experience**: Verify responsive behavior on mobile devices
4. **Consider Re-enabling RLS**: Plan to restore Row Level Security with proper policies
